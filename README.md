# mbitmaps
Bitmap index engine, written in Mumps

This routine gives all the functionalities, needed to manage bitmap indexes in a M database system.
The routine is written in ISO-M standard M, except for the $zbit* functions, which are available in the usual M implementations.
It is in production since december 2011, with no modifications needed for the last five years.
So I might say, it is stable.

Examples will follow, hopefully ;-)
